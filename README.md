Timesink
========

A Reddit viewer that *should* run on mobile browsers. A replacement for
the native Reddit app i wrote a while ago using libgdx.

Still learning, happy for pull requests and improvements. 

User Guide
----------
Select your subreddit of choice in the first select box. Select the type
of posts on the second select box. To add a new subreddit, click the plus
button, followed by entering the subreddits name (e.g. 'movies', minus quotes).

There's no way to login or vote, as Timesink.js uses the read-only APIs of
Reddit. This little thing's supposed to be used as a viewer. Click on the
comments link if you want to vote/comment on an item.
